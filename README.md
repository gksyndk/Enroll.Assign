(Student Enrollment System)


## Objective
Create a Python-based Course Enrollment System using dictionaries, loops, and functions.
The system will allow students able to register for their desired courses, drop courses if necessary, 
and keep track of their enrollment status with ease. 
The system should also provide administrative staff with the tools they need to manage 
course availability, view enrollment data, and generate reports on student course 
selections.
